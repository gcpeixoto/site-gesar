Strain localization and dislocation pattern formation are typical
features of plastic deformation in metals and alloys. Glide and climb
dislocation motion along with accompanying production-annihilation
processes of dislocations lead to the occurrence of instabilities of
initially uniform dislocation distributions. These instabilities result
into the development of various types of dislocation micro-structures,
such as dislocation cells, slip and kink bands, persistent slip bands,
labyrinth structures, etc., depending on the externally applied loading
and the intrinsic lattice constraints. We model dislocation dynamics in
materials subjected to cyclic loading by using a two-equations
reaction-diffusion model proposed by Walgraef and Aifanits (J. Appl.
Phys., 58, 668, 1985)
