{% mark excerpt -%}

Two-phase flows are widely found in nature. The presence of immiscible
fluids can be seen in all kinds of application, such as in the surface
contact between ocean and atmosphere or at petroleum extraction
industry, in which gas bubbles are formed at a high-temperature process.
A numerical approach is used to discretize the fluid movement equations
through the finite element method. Thereby, complex geometries can be
modeled by a computational mesh of tetrahedral elements.
