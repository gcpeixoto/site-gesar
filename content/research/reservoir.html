{% mark excerpt -%}

About 90% of the Brazilian power sources is compounded by hydropower
plants and new unities are currently being built. The impact assessment
of the massive use of hydrous resources and ecosystems demands new
tools intended to analyze both the deployment of plants and the search
for operational alternatives for existing reservoirs. During the filling of
the reservoirs, the terrestrial biomass is decomposed and turned into
substances which are transported over the stream and accumulated in
their compartments. Therefore, some regions are affected by the low
level of dissolved oxigen and high concentration of organic matter
which, in turn, damage the aquatic environment.
