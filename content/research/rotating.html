{% mark excerpt -%}

This research front has started up in 1998 in response to a
conjecture made by the Applied Electrochemistry group from 
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro whether the current oscillations
observed experimentally in rotating-disk electrochemical cells  
could result from a hydrodynamic instability. The rotating disk
electrode is formed by a 5mm iron cylinder with epoxy coating over the
sidewalls which allow that the current flows only through the basis of
the cylinder, where the hydrodynamic field is modeled by the von
K&aacute;rm&aacute;n's classical solution.
