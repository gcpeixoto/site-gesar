Strain localization and dislocation pattern formation are typical
features of plastic deformation in metals and alloys. Glide and climb
dislocation motion along with accompanying production -annihilation
processes of dislocations lead to the occurrence of instabilities of
initially uniform dislocation distributions. These instabilities result
into the development of various types of dislocation micro-structures,
such as dislocation cells, slip and kink bands, persistent slip bands,
labyrinth structures, etc., depending on the externally applied loading
and the intrinsic lattice constraints. The Walgraef-Aifantis (WA)
(Walgraef and Aifanits, J. Appl. Phys., 58, 668, 1985) model is an
example of a reaction-diffusion model of coupled nonlinear equations
which describe  formation of forest (immobile),  and gliding (mobile)
dislocation densities in the presence of cyclic loading. The model
reads: Static and mobile dislocation densities are denoted by
&rho;<sub>s</sub> and &rho;<sub>m</sub> respectively, time is measured
in number of cycles of loading, Ds represents the effective diffusion
within the forest resulting from the thermal mobility and climb and Dm
represents the effective diffusion resulting from the glide of mobile
dislocations between obstacles (Dm ≫ Ds). The coefficient dc is the
characteristic length of spontaneous dipole collapse. &beta; is the rate
of dislocation freeing from the forest and is associated with the
de-stabilization of dislocation dipoles or clusters under stress. We use
two versions of the WA model, the first one comprising linear diffusion
of the density of mobile dislocations and the second one, with nonlinear
diffusion of said variable. A finite difference, second order in time
Cranck-Nicholson semi-implicit scheme, with internal iterations at each
time step and a spatial splitting using the Stabilizing, Correction
(Christov and Pontes, Mathematical and Computer 0, 35, 87, 2002) is used
for solving the model evolution equations in two dimensions. The
discussion on the WA model and on the numerical scheme was presented by
Pontes et al. (AIP Conference Proceedings, Vol. 1301 pp. 511-519, 2010
and T. Proulx (ed.), Optical Measurements, Modeling, and Metrology,

Results were obtained both for simulations, with linear diffusion of the
mobile dislocations and three with nonlinear diffusion are presented.
The simulations mimic several phenomena experimentally observed, like
the increase of the fundamental wavelength of the structure, the
increase of the walls height and the decrease of its thickness.
